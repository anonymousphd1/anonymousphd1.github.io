Now I am in the second year of my phD studies. Don't ask me how I am feeling right now. Worried and anxious at the same time. Now I understand the real struggle of PhD students now. I usually hear from my colleagues, reading or watching from PhD student on SNS. The real struggle hits me now. However, I am enjoying my journey even though I am not sure will I reach the destination or just give up in the middle of the road later. I am still enjoying that i can manage my time smartly, also study and research with my capabilities. Luckily, the lab that I am working now, is not under pressure and no weekly meetings. You can do at your own pace. The downside, if you are doing your research alone and  you will get stuck alone as well. You donâ€™t have someone you can talk to (actually you can with your lab member) but mostly we love to keep our problems to ourselves. Luckily, I got some lab members that I can talk to now. The goal this year, I shall finish my experiment, present the result, and hopefully I can submit to a conference. After that, have to find the novelty and submit to a journal.

Again the anxiety hits me. But anxiety again can be my friend as a reminder to finish my PhD no matter what. What I can do is to keep moving forward and believe in myself. Whenever I feel stuck, I usually do my hobby, either art or piano. Or even taking a break a day off. After that, I can continue to code again and keep wondering in the overwhelming information and experiment.

I almost didn't finish my master's before due to my toxic supervisor, but I believe I can finish my PhD! Ganbatte.
